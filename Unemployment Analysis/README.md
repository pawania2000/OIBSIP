I recently completed an unemployment analysis project utilizing Python and several libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.Express. I utilized these libraries to effectively import, process, and analyze data to evaluate the unemployment rate and gain insights into the job market. To showcase the findings, I visualized the data using line charts, box plots, and bar charts. This project allowed me to enhance my data analysis skills and develop my expertise in using various data visualization tools. I am excited to continue exploring projects that challenge me to expand my knowledge in this field.
